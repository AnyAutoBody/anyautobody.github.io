##### Fiberglass body kit installation, wheel flares installation

Whether it’s a full body kit or a subtle flare upgrade, I make sure everything fits right and flows clean. These aren’t just cosmetic changes — they improve stance, boost aerodynamics, and give the car a presence that stands out.

Curious what really goes into a fiberglass body kit install or custom wheel flare integration?

##### Classic Chevy Business Coupe Restoration
Restoring this timeless car was a deep dive into true classic car craftsmanship. It started with a complete strip-down of more than 27 layers of old paint, primer, sealer, putty, and filler removed by sand blasting. What was left behind was a raw, honest body, ready to be brought back to life. Hit play and see what goes into a true show-quality finish.
