`Project Spotlight: 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Collision Repair`

This full-scale collision repair on a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee was a true display of precision and craftsmanship. The job involved extensive frame pulling, replacement of both inner and outer body panels, and the installation of a new headlamp, grille, and complete front bumper assembly.

From structural realignment to final paintwork, every detail was restored to factory specifications, or better. The result is a seamless repair that brought back the Grand Cherokeeâ€™s strength, safety, and bold original look.
